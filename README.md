# Spark-EmailDump-Analyser
Use Apache Spark to parse and analyse large email dumps. 
Wikileaks releases many email dumps such as the Podesta email files. This project uses Apache Spark infrastructure to generate a csv file of the data and a NodeList/EdgeList which can then be used to perform Network Analysis.
The project also does Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on the contents of the email dump.
